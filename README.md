# ðŸŒ³ Forest Ecosystem Stability
This repository contains the code and analysis for my master's thesis, which investigates critical transitions in forest ecosystems using agent-based models. The project aims to understand how ecosystem tipping points change with increasing complexity of positive feedbacks inherent in local-scale ecosystem models.

## ðŸ“œ Abstract
Several large ecosystems face irreversible, abrupt transitions to different states, such as a rainforest transitioning to a savannah. These shifts are driven by positive feedbacks that become dominant at _tipping points_ (TPs).
  _Critical slowing down_ (CSD) can be used to predict TPs by monitoring increased variability in observables, acting as _early-warning signals_ (EWS). My research explores how spatial feedback mechanisms affect forest resilience and investigates if classic tipping point theory applies to more complex ecological systems.

## ðŸ’» Methodology
- Model Construction: Two agent-based forest ecosystem models were constructed to examine the effects of local vs. non-local positive feedbacks. The agent-based approach ensures that the saddle-node bifurcation is not _baked in_ to the model via governing differential equations.
- Numerical Simulation: The project numerically found different stable vegetation configurations within the models and determined their bifurcations as the simulation control parameter was varied.
- Data Analysis: The simulations were used to constrain under which circumstances abrupt, system-wide collapse could be expected and to assess whether a collapse could be predicted from real-world observations. I analyzed whether CSD could be detected in a spatially explicit model with local interactions.

## ðŸ”¬ Results
Our findings show that agent-based models can exhibit tipping dynamics, characterized by multistability and a bifurcation emerging from the inherent agent-based dynamics. The presence of multiple early warning signals (EWS) in our simulations seems to confirm that the classical framework for predicting tipping points remains applicable to such systems.
